Usage: Scrub_Stratec_.py [options] source-file(s)/directory [destination file/directory]

This program modifies the headers of Stratec pQCT files to zero-out the
Patient Name and round the DOB to the 1st of the nearest month. Month rounding
causes a DOB of 1956-12-17 to be changed to 1957-01-01, and 1956-12-16 to be
changed to 1956-12-01 (birth month is favored for midway dates)

Options:
  -f  force in-place conversion without verification when no destination is
	  specified
  -q  don't print progress information to stdout
  -h  show this help message and exit

This script can be run from the command-line, using Python's Tkinter GUI, or as a Fiji plugin (http://Fiji.sc/Fiji).
Copy the Scrub_Stratec_.py file to Fiji's plugins folder and it will appear in the Plugins menu as "Scrub Stratec"

The GUI implementations will ask the user for source and destination directories.  Modified files will
be in the destination directory, and the files in the source directory will remain unmodified.

The CLI allows in-place file modifications, and works with single files, lists of source files, or source/destination directories.
