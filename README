Usage: Scrub_Stratec_.py [options] source-file(s)/directory [destination file/directory]

This program modifies the headers of Stratec pQCT files to zero-out the
Patient Name and round the DOB to the 1st of the nearest month. Month rounding
causes a DOB of 1956-12-17 to be changed to 1957-01-01, and 1956-12-16 to be
changed to 1956-12-01 (birth month is favored for midway dates)

Options:
  -f  force in-place conversion without verification when no destination is
	  specified
  -q  don't print progress information to stdout
  -h  show this help message and exit
